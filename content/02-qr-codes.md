### What It Does
Generate dynamic, trackable QR codes that connect your physical world to digital experiences. Update destinations anytime—without reprinting. Track every scan with the same precision as your short links.

### Why It Matters (Business Value)
- **Bridge Physical & Digital**: Turn any printed material into an interactive experience.
- **Future-Proof Printing**: Change QR destinations without reprinting menus, packaging, or signage.
- **Full Attribution**: Know exactly which physical placements drive engagement.
- **Brand Consistency**: Customize QR appearance with colors, logos, and frames that match your brand.
- **Offline Activation**: Reach audiences in places where clicking a link isn't possible.

## How It Works (Step-by-Step User Flow)

**Step 1: Enter Your Destination**
Paste any URL—landing page, app download, PDF, video, payment link, or even a vCard.

**Step 2: Choose QR Type**
- **Dynamic QR** (recommended): Destination can be changed anytime. Full scan analytics.
- **Static QR**: Destination is baked into the code. No analytics. Cannot be edited.

**Step 3: Customize Appearance**
- Select foreground and background colors
- Add your logo in the center
- Choose corner styles (rounded, square, dots)
- Add a frame with call-to-action text
- Adjust error correction level for busy designs

**Step 4: Download & Deploy**
- Download in PNG, SVG, or PDF format
- Choose resolution based on print size
- Test scan before mass printing

**Step 5: Track & Optimize**
- Monitor scans in real-time
- See geographic and device data
- Update destination based on performance
- A/B test different placements

## Key Capabilities

1. **Dynamic QR Codes** — Change the destination URL anytime without regenerating the code.

2. **Scan Analytics** — Track total scans, unique scans, location, device, and time.

3. **Custom Colors** — Match QR codes to your brand palette. Foreground, background, and corner colors.

4. **Logo Integration** — Add your logo to the center of the QR code while maintaining scannability.

5. **Multiple Download Formats** — PNG for digital use, SVG for unlimited scaling, PDF for print-ready output.

6. **Resolution Control** — Generate QR codes at the exact size needed—from business cards to billboards.

## Example QR Placements & Scenarios

### Placement Strategy Matrix

## Analytics You Get

### Core Metrics
| Metric | What It Tells You |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Total Scans** | Overall engagement with this QR code |
| **Unique Scans** | How many different devices scanned (vs. repeat scans) |
| **Scan Rate Over Time** | Trend analysis—is engagement increasing or declining? |
| **Geographic Distribution** | Country, region, city where scans happen |
| **Device Type** | iOS vs. Android vs. Other |
| **Time of Day/Week** | When people engage most |
| **Top Performing QRs** | Compare codes across campaigns |

### How to Interpret
- **High scans, low conversions?** QR is working—destination page needs optimization.
- **Low scans in high-traffic area?** QR might be too small, poorly placed, or missing a CTA.
- **Scans from unexpected locations?** Someone shared the destination link digitally.
- **Weekend spike?** Your audience engages more during personal time.
- **Morning scans?** Commuters engaging with transit ads.

### Attribution Workflow
1. Create unique QR for each placement (same destination, different codes)
2. Name each QR clearly: "Table-Tent-Window-Seat", "Receipt-May-2024"
3. Compare scan performance across placements
4. Double down on winners, retire losers

## FAQs

**Q1: What's the difference between dynamic and static QR codes?**
Dynamic QR codes point to a short link that you control—you can change the destination anytime and get scan analytics. Static QR codes encode the destination URL directly into the code—once printed, it cannot be changed, and you get no analytics.

**Q2: Can I edit a QR code after printing?**
If it's a dynamic QR code, yes—you can change where it points at any time. The visual QR code pattern stays the same, but the destination changes. Static QR codes cannot be edited.

**Q3: How do I ensure my QR code scans reliably?**
- Maintain high contrast between foreground and background
- Don't make the logo too large (max 30% of QR area)
- Use at least "M" level error correction
- Test on multiple devices before printing
- Ensure adequate size for viewing distance

**Q4: Can I add my logo without breaking the QR code?**
Yes, with error correction. QR codes can tolerate up to 30% damage/obstruction. Keep your logo under 25-30% of the total area and use high error correction (H level).

**Q5: What file format should I download?**
- **PNG**: For digital use, presentations, documents
- **SVG**: For any size printing (scales infinitely without quality loss)
- **PDF**: For professional print production

**Q6: How small can a QR code be?**
Minimum 0.8" x 0.8" (2cm x 2cm) for close-up scanning. For every 10 feet of viewing distance, add roughly 2 inches to the size.

**Q7: Do QR codes expire?**
Dynamic QR codes don't expire unless you set an expiration date. They'll work as long as your account is active. Static QR codes never expire—they're self-contained.

**Q8: Can I generate QR codes in bulk?**
Yes. Upload a CSV with your URLs and settings. We'll generate a ZIP file with all your QR codes, properly named.

**Q9: What content types can I link to?**
Any URL: websites, PDFs, videos, app store links, Google Maps locations, Zoom meetings, payment links, and more. Plus special types: vCards, WiFi credentials, plain text.

**Q10: How do I track which physical location performs best?**
Create a unique QR code for each placement pointing to the same destination. Compare scan analytics by QR code to see which locations drive the most engagement.

## Limitations & Best Practices

### Technical Limitations
- **Logo size**: Maximum 30% of QR area for reliable scanning
- **Color contrast**: Minimum 40% contrast ratio between foreground/background
- **URL length**: Shorter URLs = simpler QR patterns = easier scanning
- **Special characters**: URLs with unusual characters may create complex patterns

### Scannability Best Practices
- **Test before printing**: Always scan with at least 3 different devices
- **Quiet zone**: Leave white space around the QR code (minimum = 4 "modules" wide)
- **Avoid glossy surfaces**: Glare reduces scannability
- **Lighting matters**: Ensure adequate lighting in placement area
- **Camera angle**: QR should be viewable straight-on, not at extreme angles

### Design Best Practices
- **Keep it simple**: Overly decorative QRs have lower scan rates
- **CTA is critical**: "Scan Here" increases engagement by up to 80%
- **Match brand, don't overpower**: QR supports the message, not the other way around
- **Position strategically**: Eye-level, natural stopping points, away from creases

### Print Best Practices
- **Use vector (SVG)**: Never stretch a PNG beyond its original resolution
- **CMYK for print**: Convert colors from RGB for accurate printing
- **Test substrate**: Some materials (textured, metallic) reduce scannability
- **Provide bleed**: Extend background beyond QR boundary for edge-to-edge printing
