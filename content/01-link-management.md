# LINK MANAGEMENT / URL SHORTENER

## Module Overview

---

### What It Does
Transform any long, complex URL into a clean, branded short link that's easy to share, track, and manage. Full control over every link you create—from custom aliases to destination updates.

### Why It Matters (Business Value)
- **Brand Recognition**: Every link becomes a brand touchpoint. Custom domains mean your audience sees YOUR brand, not a generic shortener.
- **Higher Click-Through Rates**: Short, branded links get 34% more clicks than generic shortened URLs.
- **Complete Visibility**: Know exactly who clicked, when, where, and on what device.
- **Flexibility**: Update destinations without breaking existing links—no more dead ends.
- **Campaign Control**: Organize thousands of links with folders, tags, and smart filtering.

## How It Works (Step-by-Step User Flow)

**Step 1: Paste Your Long URL**

**Step 2: Customize Your Link**
- Choose a custom back-half (slug): `yourbrand.link/summer-sale`
- Add a descriptive title for internal reference
- Select a branded domain (if configured)
- Add tags for organization: `campaign:summer`, `channel:email`

**Step 3: Configure Link Behavior**
- Set redirect type (301 permanent / 302 temporary)
- Schedule activation and expiration dates
- Enable/disable link (pause without deleting)
- Set click limits if needed

**Step 4: Share & Track**

- Share across any channel
- Watch real-time analytics as clicks come in

**Step 5: Manage & Optimize**

## Example Scenarios

### Example Short Link Naming Conventions

| Use Case | Long URL | Short Link |
|----------|----------|------------|
| Product Launch | `yoursite.com/products/new-widget-2024-launch-special-offer?utm_source=email` | `go.brand.com/newwidget` |
| Event Registration | `eventplatform.com/register/annual-conference-2024-early-bird` | `go.brand.com/conference24` |
| Support Article | `help.yoursite.com/articles/12847392-how-to-reset-password` | `go.brand.com/reset-help` |
| Social Bio | `yoursite.com/landing/social-media-exclusive-offer-instagram` | `go.brand.com/insta` |
| Print Campaign | `yoursite.com/promo/summer-2024-catalog-print-exclusive` | `go.brand.com/summer` |
| Partner Referral | `yoursite.com/signup?ref=partner123&campaign=q4` | `go.brand.com/partner-acme` |

### Naming Best Practices
- **Keep it short**: 5-15 characters for the slug
- **Make it readable**: Use hyphens, not underscores
- **Be descriptive**: Someone should guess where it goes
- **Avoid dates**: Unless the date is meaningful (e.g., `webinar-jan15`)
- **Use lowercase**: Prevents case-sensitivity confusion

## Analytics You Get

### Core Metrics
| Metric | What It Tells You |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Total Clicks** | Overall link performance |

| **Device Breakdown** | Mobile vs. Desktop vs. Tablet |
| **Browser & OS** | Chrome, Safari, iOS, Android, Windows, etc. |

### How to Interpret

## FAQs

**Q1: Can I edit a link's destination after it's been shared?**
Yes. You can change where any link points at any time. Existing shares will automatically redirect to the new destination.

**Q2: What happens to my analytics if I change the destination?**
Analytics continue to accumulate on the same link. You'll see total historical data, but you can filter by date to compare before/after performance.

**Q3: How many links can I create?**
Depends on your plan. Free accounts have monthly limits. Paid plans offer significantly higher or unlimited link creation.

**Q4: Can I use my own domain for short links?**
Yes. You can connect custom domains (e.g., `go.yourcompany.com`) on paid plans. We provide DNS configuration instructions.

**Q5: What's the difference between 301 and 302 redirects?**
301 = permanent redirect (better for SEO, search engines transfer link value). 302 = temporary redirect (better for campaigns where the destination may change).

**Q6: Can I password-protect a link?**
Yes. Enable password protection on any link. Visitors will need to enter the password before being redirected.

**Q7: Do links expire?**
Only if you set an expiration date. Otherwise, links remain active indefinitely unless you disable or delete them.

**Q8: Can I see who clicked my link?**
You see aggregated anonymous data (device, location, time). You don't see personal information like names or email addresses unless your destination page captures that.

**Q9: What happens if I delete a link?**
The short URL stops working immediately. Visitors will see a 404 error. This action cannot be undone.

**Q10: Can I create links in bulk?**
Yes. Upload a CSV file with your long URLs. We'll generate short links for all of them. Download the results as a CSV.

## Limitations & Best Practices

### Platform Limitations
- **Slug uniqueness**: Each slug must be unique per domain. First-come, first-served.
- **Character limits**: Slugs can be 3-50 characters. Destination URLs up to 2,048 characters.
- **Rate limits**: API calls are rate-limited based on your plan (see API docs).
- **Reserved slugs**: System paths like `/login`, `/api`, `/settings` cannot be used as slugs.

### Deliverability Best Practices
- **Warm up new domains**: Start with low-volume sending before mass distribution.
- **Avoid spam trigger words**: Even in slugs, words like "free-money" may cause issues.
- **Use HTTPS destinations**: Links to HTTP sites may show browser warnings.
- **Monitor blacklists**: We scan for blacklisting, but monitor your domain reputation.

### Link Hygiene
- **Archive old campaigns**: Don't delete—archive. You keep the analytics and prevent the slug from being reused accidentally.
- **Audit regularly**: Review links quarterly. Disable anything no longer needed.
- **Document naming conventions**: Create a team style guide for consistent slug naming.
- **Tag everything**: Future-you will thank present-you when searching for old campaigns.
