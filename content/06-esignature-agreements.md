Yes. The signing experience is fully responsive. Signers can use any device with a web browser—no app download required.

Depends on your plan. Standard plans: 7 years. Enterprise: configurable. You can also download and store copies in your own systems.

## Limitations & Best Practices

### Platform Limitations
- **Document size**: Maximum 25MB per document
- **Page count**: Maximum 100 pages per document
- **Signers**: Maximum 20 signers per document
- **Fields per page**: Maximum 50 signature/form fields per page
- **Storage**: Plan-dependent limits on stored documents

### Document Best Practices
- **Use PDF format**: Most reliable rendering across devices
- **Keep documents concise**: Long documents have lower completion rates
- **Clear field placement**: Don't crowd signature fields
- **Readable fonts**: Minimum 10pt for signing on mobile
- **Test before sending**: Preview on mobile and desktop

### Signing Experience Best Practices

- **Configure reminders**: 2-3 reminders typically optimal
- **Provide context**: Tell signers what they're signing and why
- **Minimize required fields**: Only require what's truly necessary

### Compliance Best Practices
- **Know your requirements**: Some documents may require specific signature types
- **Keep records**: Download and store signed documents in your records system
